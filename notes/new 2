- what's the hook? why would I want to play this game? what sets it apart from all of the other games?

  The game is an experiment that combines Devil Dagger's fast pace and roguelite elements to give players choice to experiment and suit their style.


- i'm more interested in the gameplay than in the setting. the setting can be a selling point but only if it's particularly original/attractive. 
  the gameplay is generally more important - what's interesting in your gameplay?

  The game focuses on magic leveling and combining skill branches to create special and unique spells.


- give me the most engaging 12 words (max) pitch you can think of for this game. tip: do not mention anything that isn't exciting. 
(who cares about 2D, score and points whatever - just "kill as many" or "take the first place on the global leaderboard")
  
  Combine skills and create spells to vanquish scientists and conquere the leaderboard.

- get creative, replace boring words with more engaging ones: "the player controls the last mage" -> "you are the last mage"
"who needs to survive against a horde of scientists ..." -> "you will face a murderous horde of scientists ..."
"score as much points ..." -> "destroy as much/many as you can to climb up the wall of fame"

      "Save the Mage" is a 2d fast-paced shooter where YOU, last mage on earth, get to fight through waves of evil scientists
      trying to keep you from becoming the strongest Wizard. Combine skills to make custom spells and compete against
      everyone else for the highest place on the Leaderboard.

etc
As I say, "it's video games, it can hardly be too much"
The game might be solid, from your pitch it sounds pretty reasonable from a dev perspective, which is good. But yeah, you gotta make it shine.
I'm also interested in your hypothetical timeline and main features if you have that (keep it short though, please :X)
PS: I'm gonna be hard with you but it's because I want you to get better.
